@Jackson: Would you be able to send me the latest? Is this any different from the spreadsheet that we reviewed a few weeks ago?

The context is that we're trying to get Pavel up to speed on model assumptions etc. and figured what you have is the best way to do this. Also want to better understand what you're updating on an ongoing basis so that we can hopefully help you out on this stuff going forward.

I don't think there should be any sensitivities but if so, please lmk so we can address.

Thx!
